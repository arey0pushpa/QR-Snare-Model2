The basic idea is to check activity of a molecule :

  f(x0, x1, ... , xn) = 1 means the argument molecules caused the inhibition.
  
  if f(x0 , .. , xn) = 0 means the argument molecules were not able to cause inhibition 
                               and hence the molecule is active.
  
 FUSION CHECK : 
 
 f(x0 ... xn) = 1 in order for fusion to happen.

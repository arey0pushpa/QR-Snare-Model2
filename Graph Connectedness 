Correspondence between Graph Connectedness and Rules we Use * For QR Model Of Vesicular Traffic:

   Model Name                                         Necessary Condition          Sufficient 

1. Arbitrary Boolean Model:                             2 Connected-ness           3-Connected        

       
2. Only Fusion Matrix Model:                            No Graphs 


3. Fusion Matrix (q-r) (r-q)                            No Graphs (May be due to 
   + Inhibition on Node                                           No self-edges)                         
     (Arbitrary Boolean Func)

                                  
4. Fusion Matrix (q-r) (r-q)                            3 Connectedness
   + Inhibition on Node
     (Arbitrary Boolean Func)

      
5.  Fusion Matrix (q-r) (r-q)                           Higher Connectedness Than 4 
   + Inhibition on Node                                 (Till now i haven't found any higher conectivilty.
( the same Matrix used for fusion)                        i have checked till N(node) = 4 and E(edges) = 12)
                                        

 6.  Fusion Matrix (q-r) (r-q)                          3 Connectedness
   + Inhib on Node    +   Inhib on Edge
 (Arbitrary Boolean Func)  (Arb Boolean Func)

    
 7.   Fusion Matrix (q-r) (r-q)                         4 Connectedness             4 conectdness
  +Inhibition on Node + Inhibition on Edge
 (Arb Boolean Func)  (same Matrix used for fusion)                            


* No Self Edges are allowed. I enforced that No self-edges are allowed in my code i.e., Graph[i][j] where i == j should be 0.
